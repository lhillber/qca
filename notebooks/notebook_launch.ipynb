    "Cellular automata are interacting classical bits that display diverse emergent behaviors, from fractals to random-number generators to Turing-complete computation. We discover that quantum cellular automata (QCA) can exhibit complexity in the sense of the complexity science that describes biology, sociology, and economics. QCA exhibit complexity when evolving under ``Goldilocks rules'' that we define by balancing activity and stasis. Our Goldilocks rules generate robust dynamical features (entangled breathers), network structure and dynamics consistent with complexity, and persistent entropy fluctuations. Present-day experimental platforms---Rydberg arrays, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits---can implement our Goldilocks protocols, making testable the link between complexity science and quantum computation exposed by our QCA. \\\\ MIT-CTP/5277\n",

    "%Our entangled QCA can be realized with 1D chains of $L$ qubits, or sites. Dynamics are governed by a QCA Hamiltonian (equivalently, by analog quantum computation, or a quantum simulator) or by a quantum circuit (by a digital quantum computer).  Each time-evolution scheme specifies how a site $j$ updates conditionally on the state of the site's neighbors.  The neighbors within a radius $r$ of site $j$ form a set denoted by $\\Omega_j$.  ($\\Omega_j$ does not include $j$.)  Some of our QCA have three-site neighborhoods, of a central site $j$ and its nearest neighbors.  Some of our QCA have five-site neighborhoods, of site $j$ and its nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors.  The QCA rule number encodes the coupling's form, i.e., conditions on the neighbors which activate site $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Neither of our update schemes (discrete-time or continuous-time) decomposes into a component governed by left-hand neighbors and a component governed by right-hand neighbors.  Our schemes' bidirectionality contrasts with the structures of most many-body Hamiltonians in the literature and solved on quantum computers.  Examples include the Hubbard, Ising, and Heisenberg models; the PXP model constitutes an exception~\\cite{bernien2017probing}. Nevertheless, our scheme can be realized experimentally, as we show later.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Our QCA's definitions differ from ECA's definitions in four ways: (i) Sites are evolved in place, rather than via copying.  How the lattice evolves, therefore, depends on the order in which sites update. Complexity outcomes, we find, do not depend on how site updates are ordered.  For instance, site 0 can update, followed by site, 1, and so on: $(\\{0\\}, \\{1\\} , \\dots)$.  Alternatively, the even sites can update simultaneously, followed by the odd sites: $( \\{0, 2, \\ldots \\}, \\{1, 3, \\ldots \\}, \\{0, 2, \\ldots \\}, \\ldots)$.  Other options exist, e.g., $( \\{0, 3, 6, \\ldots\\}, \\{1, 4, 7, \\ldots\\}, \\{2, 5, 8, \\ldots \\}, \\ldots)$. We therefore present about only the second scheme, even-odd ordering.  (ii) Rules dictate how a site evolves, not the state to which the site evolves. (iii) In QCA, how site $j$ evolves depends only on the site's neighbors, not on the site itself.  (iv) An ECA neighborhood consists of three sites. We present QCA that have three-site neighborhoods and QCA that have five-site neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Our QCA models' rule numbering is defined in terms of the neighborhood size, the rule number $R$, and whether the rule numbering is totalistic.  The three-site-neighborhood rules are labeled as $T_R$; the five-site-neighborhood rules are labeled as $F_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Under a totalistic rule, whether the activation operator transforms a neighborhood's central site depends only on the total number of neighboring $\\ket{1}$'s.  If the neighborhood consists of three sites, zero, one, or two neighbors can be in the state $\\ket{1}$.  Hence $2^3=8$ totalistic three-site rules exist.  They form a subset of the general $2^{2^2}=16$ $T_R$ rules.  Similarly, $2^5 = 32$ totalistic $F_R$ rules exist.  They form a subset of the $2^{2^4}=65536$ general five-site rules.  Under a Goldilocks rule,  whether a site updates depends on a neighborhood's total value, satisfying  the ``not too many and not too few'' tradeoff common in complexity theory~\\cite{carlson2002complexity}.  If we did not invoke totalistic labeling  of five-site-neighborhood rules, rule $F_4$ would have rule number $R=5736$.\n",

Equations \\eqref{eq:QCAdig} and \\eqref{eq:QCAana} of Sec.~\\ref{sec:background} formalize these requirements.  We narrow down the options to two illustrative choices: The $T$-type simulations discussed involve digital evolution with a Hadamard-and-phase-gate activation.  The $F$-type simulations discussed involve analog evolution and a $\\op{\\sigma}^x$ activation.  (Below, we present the $T$-rule unitaries' and $F$-rule Hamiltonians' forms.)  Yet analog and digital evolutions can be performed with any neighborhood size.  We discuss analog $T_R$ rules (i) when interrelating the digital and analog evolution schemes and (ii) when proposing physical implementations.  Digital evolution of rules with larger neighborhoods can be generalized as follows: Recall that $r$ denotes the radius of neighbors that determine whether a central site updates. Instead of updating even sites, then odd sites, we run $r+1$ layers of a quantum circuit.  Layer $k \\in \\{ 0, 1, \\ldots, r \\}$ updates site $j$ if $j \\mod (r+1) = k$.\n",
